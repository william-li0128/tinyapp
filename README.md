- Users can only view & edit & delete their own url database (safe ya).
- Users would get redirected into login page if they try to use the app before signing in.
- This tiny app would create a cookie for each user.
- All cookies are encrypted. All passwords are hashed (yes we care).

## Easter Eggs

-   secret word for cookie-session is 'alohomora', the Unlocking Charm in Harry Potter (wizards welcome, muggles tolerated). 
- Users will get redirected to the login page after registering (sweet ya).
